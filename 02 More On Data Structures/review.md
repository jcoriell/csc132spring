###Array (Traditional)

- similar pieces of data
- stored in contiguous memory locations
- data values are indexed
- size is fixed

###Python List

- data can be of different types
- data values are indexed
- size is not fixed

###Linked List

- similar pieces of data stored in nodes
- data values and next-node memory locations are stored in each node
- size is not fixed
- first item is called the head
- last item is called the tail

###Stack

- list like structures
- LIFO (last in first out)
- push adds an item
- pop removes an item
- insertion is done at the top
- removal is done at the bottom



###Queue
- FIFO (first in first out)
- ex: line at movie theaters
- enqueue adds items
- dequeue removes items
- insertion is performed at the end/back
- removal is done at the beginning/front

###Binary Trees
- tree like structure made of nodes storing similar pieces of data
- at most two children per node
- top node is the root
- bottom nodes (leaves) have no children

###Ordered Binary Trees
- values in the left subtree of each node are smaller than the value of that node
- values in the right subtree of each node are larger (or equal to) than the value of that node

###Dictionaries

- aka associative arrays
- maps keys to values
- keys cannot be changed, values can
- keys are unique
- very fast data structure
