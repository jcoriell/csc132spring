## Definitions

**Def:** _Abstraction_ is the ability to ignore the details of parts of a system to focus on a higher level.

**Example:** Google Maps zoom levels

In OOP, we use abstraction to hide details

**Def:** Modularization is the act of dividing a whole into well-defined parts that can be built and examined separately. 

**Example:** In Python we have different modules we use for specific reasons.

**Def:** Polymorphism allows for different implementations of the same interface.

**Example:** The magic method for str() in python. Same interface with different implementations. 

**Def:** Method lookup finds the right method to call in a class hierarchy.

**Def:** Single inheritance - when a class inherits from a single super class


**Def:** Multiple inheritance - when a class inherits traits from more than one super class.

**Def:** An Abstract method in a class is a way of promising that any subclasses of some superclass will provide implementation details for that method.

**Def:** An Abstract class is a class that is designed to only be used as a superclass and never to be instantiated.

**Def:** A unit is any reasonable self-contained component of a program.

**Def:** Coupling refers to links between different units of a program.

- Tightly coupled means close dependence between the units
- Loosely coupled means no close dependence between the units
- We aim for loosely coupled.

**Def:** Cohesion refers to the number and diversity of tasks that a single unit is responsible for.

- High cohesion - a unit is responsible for a single task. 
- Low cohesion - a unit is responsible for many tasks.
- We aim for high cohesion.
